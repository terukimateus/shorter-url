### Links

## My process

- I started with the HTML, I usually start with the Design, but since this challenge from Frontend Mentor already has the design done, I started with the HTML structure.
Shortly after, I went for a basic styling with Sass/CSS. Then I went to the tool's functionality with JavaScript.
I made the function that calculated the age, then inserted it into the form with a Click event.
After everything was working, I also added a number animation.

### Built with
